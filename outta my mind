On a scorching afternoon, I arrived here.
I found many things difficult to understand, but I will keep learning until I figure them all out.
One of my seniors got a cup of free Chaji milktea, but bu the time I found out, the promotion was already over.
However, I didn't feel regretful about it because I had an upset stomach today.
